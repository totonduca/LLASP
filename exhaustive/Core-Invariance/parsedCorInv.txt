generated: 
Produce an ASP solution that disallows the "lake" predicate with value 1 from being mapped to the "cloud" label.
Answer: :-assign(1,cloud).
Explanation: The predicate "moto" includes the "car" label, and the predicate "cloud" includes the "shape" label.
The predicate "person" includes the "car" label, but not the "shape" label.
So, the predicate "moto" includes the "car" label, but not the "shape" label, if the "car" label is assigned to the "cloud" label.
The predicate "person" includes the "car" label, but not the "shape" label, if the "car" label is assigned to the "shape" label.
Therefore, the predicate "person" includes the "car" label, but not

generated: 
Produce an ASP solution that disallows the "lake" predicate with value 1 from being mapped to the "cloud" label.
Answer: :-assign(1,cloud).
Explanation: The predicate "moto" includes the "car" label, and the predicate "cloud" includes the "shape" label.
The predicate "person" includes the "car" label, but not the "shape" label.
So, the predicate "moto" includes the "car" label, but not the "shape" label, if the "car" label is assigned to the "shape" label.
The predicate "person" includes the "car" label, but not the "shape" label, if the "car" label is assigned to the "shape" label.

facts:

generated: 
Draft an ASP program to prevent the predicate "black" with value 2 from being linked to the label "barcelona".
Answer: :-assign(2,barcelona).
Explanation: The predicate "black" with value 2 is linked to the label "london".
The predicate "london" with value 2 is linked to the label "rome".
The predicate "rome" with value 2 is linked to the label "brown".
So, the predicate "black" with value 2 is not linked to the label "rome".
The predicate "black" with value 2 is not linked to the label "brown".
The predicate "black" with value 2 is not linked to the label "london".
Therefore, the predicate "black" with value 2 is not linked to the label "rome".

Formulate an ASP solution to establish the transitive closure of the "wall" predicate, defined as "family".
Answer: family(X,Y):-wall(X,Y).
family(X,Y):-wall(X,Z),family(Z,Y).
```
The predicate "family" extends the transitive closure of the "wall" predicate by requiring the "Z" predicate to be a member of the "Y" predicate.
```
wall(X,Y):-family(X,Y).
wall(X,Y):-wall(X,Z),family(Z,Y).

This solution ensures that the transitive closure "family" includes all combinations of elements from the "wall" predicate.

question: 
Develop an ASP application to disallow connecting the "owner" predicate having value 2 with the "roof" label.

answer from file: 
:-assign(2,roof).

facts:

generated: 
Develop an ASP application to disallow connecting the "owner" predicate having value 2 with the "roof" label.
Answer: :-assign(2,roof).
Explanation: The predicate "author" includes the label "roof", and the predicate "object" includes the label "brown".
The predicate "assign" allows the "owner" predicate having value 2 to be connected to the "rome" label.
The predicate "brown" allows the "object" predicate having the "brown" label to be connected to the "table" label.
Therefore, the predicate "disallow" allows the "owner" predicate having value 2 with the "rome" label to be connected to the "table" label.
The predicate "author" includes the label "rome", and the predicate "table" includes the label "brown".

The predicate "cosenza" includes fields "ID","shape","city","price","name", and the label "flower" is associated with the "name" predicate.
The predicate "name" includes fields "ID","shape".
So, the predicate "select" includes fields "ID","shape".

question: 
Develop an ASP application to disallow connecting the "owner" predicate having value 2 with the "roof" label.

answer from file: 
:-assign(2,roof).

facts: 
owner(1..20).

generated: 
Develop an ASP application to disallow connecting the "owner" predicate having value 2 with the "roof" label.
Answer: :-assign(2,roof).
Explanation: The predicate "author" includes the label "roof", and the predicate "object" contains the value 2. The predicate "assign" allows the "owner" predicate having value 2 to be connected to the "rome" label. The predicate "florence" allows the "object" predicate to be connected to the "rome" label. The predicate "florence" is not applicable in this scenario. Therefore, the predicate "author" disallows the connection of the "owner" predicate having value 2 with the "rome" label.

Draft an ASP program to prevent the predicate "strength" with value 8 from being linked to the label "singapore".

facts:

generated: 
Draft an ASP program to prevent the predicate "strength" with value 8 from being linked to the label "singapore".
Answer: :-assign(8,singapore).
Explanation: The predicate "strength" with value 8 is linked to the label "table".
The predicate "table" with value 8 is linked to the label "london".
The predicate "london" with value 8 is linked to the label "rome".
So, the predicate "strength" with value 8 is not linked to the label "rome".
The predicate "rome" with value 8 is linked to the label "table".
Therefore, the Prolog program to prevent the predicate "strength" with value 8 from being linked to the label "rome" is :-assign(8,table).

Explanation: The predicate "black" with value 2 is linked to the label "london".
The predicate "london" with value 2 is linked to the label "rome".
The predicate "rome" with value 2 is linked to the label "brown".
So, the predicate "black" with value 2 is linked to the label "brown".
The predicate "brown" with value 2 is linked to the label "rome".

**Explanation:**

1. **laptop(X,"darkmagenta")**: This predicate retrieves all values linked to the "darkmagenta" label within the "brown" predicate.
2. **select(X):-laptop(X,"darkmagenta").**: This predicate selects all values that are linked to the "darkmagenta" label in the context of the "brown" predicate.

Develop an ASP script to capture all values linked to the "lightblue" label within the "cairo" predicate.
Answer: select(X):-cairo(X,"lightblue").

**Explanation:**

* `select(X):-cairo(X,"lightblue").` defines the predicate "select" as the transitive closure of the predicate "city".
* `city(X,Y):-X,Y,"lightblue".
* `city(X,Y):-X,Y.

**How it works:**

The predicate "select" finds all values linked to the "lightblue" label within the "cairo" predicate.
The predicate "city" finds all combinations of elements linked to the "lightblue" label.

Explanation: The predicate "table" includes the "weight" label, and the "brown" predicate has a value of 10.
The predicate "disallow" prevents the "brown" label from being assigned to the "table" predicate having value 10.

The predicate "shape" links each label to the elements it is attached to.
The predicate "price" is the transitive closure of the predicate "author".
The predicate "shape" is the transitive closure of the predicate "city".
The predicate "assign" prevents the predicate "gray" with value "1" from having label "table".

Answer: select(X):-lightblue(X,"moscow").

**Explanation:**

1. **lightblue(X,"moscow"):** This predicate searches for all values linked to the "moscow" label within the "lightblue" predicate.
2. **select(X):-** This specifies the predicate "lightblue" with the "moscow" label as the "X" predicate.

**Example Usage:**

```
lightblue(X,"tokyo").
select(X).
```

This code will fetch all values linked to the "tokyo" label within the "lightblue" predicate.

generated: 
Build an ASP solution that disallows the "black" predicate having value 3 from being assigned to the label "chair".
Answer: :-assign(3,chair).
Explanation: The predicate "table" includes the "black" predicate with value 3.

* The predicate "shape" is derived from the predicate "strength".
* The predicate "strength" is used to fetch all values linked to the "cloud" label.

The predicate " arrivant" has fields "ID","shape","height","city","price","description".
The predicate "laptop" has fields "ID","shape".

Explanation: The predicate "black" with value 2 is linked to the label "london".
The predicate "london" with value 2 is linked to the label "rome".
The predicate "rome" with value 2 is linked to the label "paris".
So, the predicate "black" with value 2 is not linked to the label "paris".
The predicate "assign" with the value 2 is not linked to the label "rome".
The predicate "rome" with the value 2 is linked to the label "paris".

Explanation: The predicate "darkmagenta" with value "8" does not have label "delhi".
The predicate "darkmagenta" with value "8" has label "new york".
The predicate "new york" does not have label "delhi".
So, the Prolog program is :-assign(8,delhi).

The predicate "table" assigns the label "lightblue" to elements that have the value 13.
