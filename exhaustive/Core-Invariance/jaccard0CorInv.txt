question: Compose an ASP script to extend the transitive closure of the predicate "cloud" and form the "family".

answer from file: family(X,Y):-cloud(X,Y).
family(X,Y):-cloud(X,Z),family(Z,Y).

facts: 
cloud(1..3, 1..4).

generated: 
Compose an ASP script to extend the transitive closure of the predicate "cloud" and form the "family".
The predicate "height" is a subset of the predicate "cloud".
The predicate "height" has fields "ID","author","age".
The predicate "cloud" has fields "ID","author".
The predicate "family" has fields "ID","author","age".
The predicate "height" is transitive to the predicate "family".
The predicate "height" has fields "ID","author","age","creator".
The predicate "creator" has fields "ID","author".
