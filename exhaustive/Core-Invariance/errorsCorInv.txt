quality("ID","pinkID","strength","lake").pink("ID","weight","lake","hair").

generated_answer: Compose an ASP script that addresses the problem by defining the predicate "quality_pink" which links each quality to the lake of pink", with "quality" having fields "ID","pinkID","strength","lake" and "pink" having fields "ID","weight","lake","hair". Define a predicate " espé" that links each quality to the "height" of "pink".
Answer: quality_pink(X,Y,_,_), espé(X,Y,_).
quality_pink(X,Y,_,_) :- quality(X,Y,_,_), pink(Y,_,_,_).
 espé(X,Y,_).
```
quality_pink(X,Y,_,_) :- quality(X,Y,_,_), pink(Y,_,_,_).
 espé(X,Y,_).
```
The predicate "quality_pink" links each quality to the lake of pink.
The predicate " espé" links each quality to the "height" of "pink".

parsed answer: quality_pink(X,Y,_,_), espé(X,Y,_).

answer from file: assign(X,"hair")|assign(X,"toronto")|assign(X,"surname")|assign(X,"butterfly"):-surname(X).

facts: 
surname(1..5).

generated_answer: Write an ASP program for the following problem. Assign exactly a label among a given set of labels to a set of elements. The set of elements is expressed by predicate surname. The labels are hair,toronto,surname,butterfly.
Answer: assign(X,"hair")|assign(X,"toronto")|assign(X,"shape")|assign(X,"brown")
```
The predicate "shape" is the transitive closure of the predicate "brown".
```
assign(X,"shape")|assign(X,"brown")
```
The predicate "tokyo" is the transitive closure of the predicate "shape".
```
assign(X,"tokyo")
```
The predicate "brown" is the transitive closure of the predicate "shape".
```
assign(X,"brown")
```
The predicate "name" is the transitive closure of the predicate "shape".
```
assign(X,"name")
```
The predicate

parsed answer: assign(X,"hair")|assign(X,"toronto")|assign(X,"shape")|assign(X,"brown")
