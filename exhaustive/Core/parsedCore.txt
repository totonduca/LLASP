question: 
Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "laptop" with value "15" from having label "cairo".

answer from file:

generated: 
Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "laptop" with value "15" from having label "cairo".
Answer: :-assign(15,cairo).
Explanation: :-assign(X,C) associates to each "X" the "C" label.
Therefore, the predicate "15" with label "city" is not associated with "city".
The predicate "15" with label "city" is associated with "city".
The predicate "15" with label "city" is not associated with "object".
The predicate "object" with label "city" is associated with "object".
So, the predicate "15" with label "city" is not associated with "object".

Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "cosenza" with value "7" from having label "toronto".
Answer: :-assign(7,toronto).
Explanation: :-assign(7,toronto) checks if the predicate "cosenza" with value "7" has label "toronto". If it does, it returns "1".
This predicate can be used as follows:

This predicate associates to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "assign" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "cloud" is used to associate to each "X" the "city".
The predicate "city" is not defined, so it is not associated to any "X".
Therefore, the predicate "assign" associates to each "X" the "city" if it exists.
The predicate "roof" with value "3" from having label "cloud" is :-assign(3,

The predicate "assign" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "cloud" is used to associate to each "X" the "city".
The predicate "city" is not defined, so it is not associated to any "X".
Therefore, the predicate "assign" associates to each "X" the "city" if it exists.
The predicate "roof" with value "3" from having label "cloud" is :-assign(3,

Write an ASP program for the following problem. Assign exactly a label among a given set of labels to a set of elements. The set of elements is expressed by predicate black. The labels are storm,pink.
Answer: assign(X,"storm")|assign(X,"pink"):-black(X).
I.e. assign(X,"storm")|assign(X,"pink"):-black(X).
The predicate "black" is not included in the predicate "assign".
The predicate "assign" is a predicate that associates to each element of the set of elements the label "storm" or "pink".
The predicate "black" associates to each element of the set of elements the label "city".
So, the predicate "assign" with value "city" is not included in the predicate "assign".

generated: 
Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "chair" with value "3" from having label "surname".
Answer: :-assign(3,surname).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate associates to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "assign" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "surname" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y".
The predicate "assign" is not applied if "X" is "3" and "Y" is "name".

Answer: :-assign(18,moscow).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate assigns to each element "X" the label "Y" if it has the label "city".
The predicate "city" is not defined, so it is not necessary to specify it.
The predicate "18" is assigned the label "city".
The predicate "18" has the label "city".
So, the predicate "18" with label "city" is not assigned the label "moscow".

Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "singapore" with value "18" from having label "butterfly".
Answer: :-assign(18,butterfly).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate associates to each "18" the "city" label.
The predicate "assign" associates to each "18" the "city" label.
The predicate "city" associates to each "city" the "green" label.
So, the predicate "assign" associates to each "18" the "green" label.
The predicate "green" associates to each "green" the "city" label.
Therefore, the predicate "assign" associates to each "18" the "city" label.

Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "owner" with value "5" from having label "pink".
Answer: :-assign(5,pink).
Explanation: :-assign(5,pink) checks if the predicate "owner" with value "5" has label "pink". If it does, it returns "1".
This predicate can be used as follows:
assign(5,pink).
This will assign to "5" the label "pink".

Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "hair" with value "6" from having label "lightblue".
Answer: :-assign(6,lightblue).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate associates to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "assign" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "lightblue" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "assign" is not applied if "Y" is "lightblue".
So, the predicate "assign" is used to prevent the predicate "hair" with value "6" from having label "lightblue".

Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "storm" with value "6" from having label "mumbai".
Answer: :-assign(6,mumbai).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate associates to each "X" the "Y" value.
The predicate "assign" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" value.
The predicate "mumbai" is used to associate to each "X" the value "6".
So, the predicate "assign" is applied to each "X" with value "6" and label "mumbai".

- `laptop(X,C)`: associates to each `X` the value of `C`.
- `select(X):-laptop(X,C),C!=71`: selects all values associated with predicate "city" with a value different than 71.

This program is written in predicate. Prevent the predicate "city" with value "7" from having label "object".

Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "roof" with value "3" from having label "cloud".
Answer: :-assign(3,cloud).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate associates to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "assign" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "cloud" is used to associate to each "X" the "city".
The predicate "city" is not defined, so it is not associated to any "X".
Therefore, the predicate "assign" associates to each "X" the "city" if it exists.
The predicate "roof" with value "3" from having label "cloud" is :-assign(3,

- `laptop(X,C)`: associates to each `X` the value of `C`.
- `select(X):-laptop(X,C),C!=71`: selects all values associated with predicate "object" with a value different than 71.

This program is written in predicate. Prevent the predicate "object" with value "7" from having label "city".
```predicate
select(X):-laptop(X,C),C!=71.
```

question: 
Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "hair" with value "6" from having label "lightblue".

generated: 
Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "hair" with value "6" from having label "lightblue".
Answer: :-assign(6,lightblue).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate associates to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "assign" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "lightblue" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "assign" is not applied if "Y" is "lightblue".
So, the predicate "assign" is applied only if "X" is "6" and "Y" is "lightblue".

Answer: :-assign(7,white).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate associates to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "assign" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "white" is used to check if the "Y" exists.
The predicate "assign" is not applicable to the predicate "white".

Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "laptop" with value "15" from having label "hair".
Answer: :-assign(15,hair).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate associates to each "15" the "hair" label.
The predicate "assign" associates to each "15" the "name" label.
The predicate "name" associates to each "name" the "city" label.
So, the predicate "assign" associates to each "15" the "city" label.
The predicate "city" associates to each "city" the "name" label.
Therefore, the predicate "assign" associates to each "15" the "name" label.

question: 
Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "hair" with value "11" from having label "laptop".

answer from file: 
:-assign(11,laptop).

facts:

generated: 
Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "hair" with value "11" from having label "laptop".
Answer: :-assign(11,laptop).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate associates to each "11" the "laptop" label.
The predicate "assign" associates to each "11" the "city" label.
The predicate "city" associates to each "city" the "name" label.
So, the predicate "assign" associates to each "11" the "name" label.
The predicate "name" associates to each "name" the "city" label.
Therefore, the predicate "assign" associates to each "11" the "city" label.

generated: 
Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "moscow" with value "9" from having label "surname".
Answer: :-assign(9,surname).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate associates to each "X" the "Y" value.
The predicate "assign" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" value.
The predicate "surname" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" value.
The predicate "assign" is not applicable to "9".
The predicate "surname" is applicable to "9".
Therefore, the predicate "assign" with value "9" from label "surname" is "1".

generated: 
Write an ASP program for the following problem. Prevent the predicate "storm" with value "6" from having label "mumbai".
Answer: :-assign(6,mumbai).
Explanation: :-assign(X,Y):-assign(X,"Y").
This predicate associates to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "assign" is used to associate to each "X" the "Y" if it exists.
The predicate "mumbai" is used to associate to each "X" the "city".
So, the predicate "assign" is applied to each "X" with label "mumbai".
The predicate "city" is applied to each "X" with label "city".
Therefore, the predicate "assign" is applied to each "X" with label "mumbai".

Write an ASP program for the following problem. Select all values associated with predicate "wall" with a value different than 41.
Answer: select(X):-wall(X,C),C!=41.
Explanation:
- `wall(X,C)`: this predicate associates to each "wall" the value of "C".
- `select(X):-wall(X,C),C!=41`: this selects all values associated with predicate "wall" with a value different than 41.

This program is written in predicate. Prevent the predicate "wall" with value "4" from having label "city".
```predicate select(X):-wall(X,C),C!=41.
