combination

question: Write an ASP program for the following problem. Generate all the combinations of elements from two sets. The two sets are represented by predicates "butterfly" and "weight".

answer from file: combination(X,Y):-butterfly(X),weight(Y).

facts: 
butterfly(1..4).weight(1..5).

generated_answer: Write an ASP program for the following problem. Generate all the combinations of elements from two sets. The two sets are represented by predicates "butterfly" and "weight".
Answer: combination(X,Y):-assign(X,"weight").
combination(X,Y):-assign(X,"city").
combination(X,Y):-assign(X,"element").
combination(X,Y):-assign(X,"creator").
combination(X,Y):-assign(X,"city".).

question: Write an ASP program for the following problem. Assign exactly a label among a given set of labels to a set of elements. The set of elements is expressed by predicate weight. The labels are quality,butterfly,chicago.

answer from file: assign(X,"quality")|assign(X,"butterfly")|assign(X,"chicago"):-weight(X).

facts: 
weight(1..5).

generated_answer: Write an ASP program for the following problem. Assign exactly a label among a given set of labels to a set of elements. The set of elements is expressed by predicate weight. The labels are quality,butterfly,chicago.
Answer: assign(X,"quality")|assign(X,"butterfly")|assign(X,"city").
I would prefer that predicate "city" with value "1" is not associated with "city".
Answer: assign(X,"city")|assign(X,"city").
Answer: assign(X,"city")|assign(X,"object").
Answer: assign(X,"city").
Explanation:
- assign(X,"quality")|assign(X,"butterfly")|assign(X,"city"):- if the value of "X" is "city" assign "city" to "X".
- assign(X,"city"):- if the value of "X" is "city"

parsed answer: assign(X,"quality")|assign(X,"butterfly")|assign(X,"city").
